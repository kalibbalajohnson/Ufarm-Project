#Ufarm Project

Ufarm is a digital platform that bridges the gap between smallholder farmers and potential buyers in Uganda. The platform allows farmers to showcase their produce and connect directly with potential buyers, eliminating intermediaries and reducing transaction costs.

The aim of Ufarm is to provide smallholder farmers with better market access and fairer prices for their produce, thus improving their livelihoods. By offering a digital marketplace, the platform also contributes to sustainable agriculture and poverty reduction in Uganda.

In addition to connecting farmers to buyers, the platform provides tools and resources for farmers to improve the quality and quantity of their produce. This includes access to training materials, best practices, and market insights.


Ufarm is built on the principles of transparency, fairness, and sustainability. The platform leverages technology to create a more efficient and equitable market for farmers and buyers alike.
